# Modern Convolutional Networks

Now that we understand the basics of wiring together convolutional neural networks, we will take you through a tour of modern deep learning.
In this chapter, each section will correspond to a significant neural network architecture that was at some point (or currently) the base model upon which an enormous amount of research and projects were built.
